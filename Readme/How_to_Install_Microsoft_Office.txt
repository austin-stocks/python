1. DO NOT PLUG IN THE USB UNLESS YOU HAVE UNINSTALLED OLD OFFICE AND DISABLED ANTIVIRUS
   AND TURNED WIRELESS OFF (MAYBE NOT REQUIRED, BUT DO IT ANYWAY), OTHERWISE THE COMPUTER 
   ANTIVIRUS WILL QUARANTIE THE KMS FILE AND THAT IS A BIT OF A HEADACHE

2. Remove all office from the computer. This will include getting it uninstall from "Unintall" 
   from Control Panel and also, Microsoft has a unintall tool, that can be downloaded from 
   their website that will uninstall office completely. 
   The control Panel does not uninstall the office completely. 
   Needless to say, you need to restart the computer after you unintall using various methods.

3. Plug in the USB. The USB has folder
	F:\MICROSOFT Office PRO Plus 2016\MICROSOFT Office PRO Plus 2016 v16.0.4266.1003 RTM + Activator [TechTools.NET]
4. In that folder - run setup 
    (If you look at the office folder in that directory, it as setup for 32-bit and 64-bit office
     I did not run any specific setup, just the setup from the directory above)

5. Once office has been installed, you can run office (say Word or Excel) but it will ask for your email 
   and tell you that the office licence will expire in 7-10 days. Now is the time to run the KMS file

6. Reboot again (disable wireless and antivius again <== VERY IMPORTANT) and then run "KMSAuto Net" 
   When you run it, be careful that we use it to activate (it will have a button to 
   activate office). Note that if the antivirus is NOT turned off, then 
   it will remove/quartine that file. 
   I have not yet found a place to recover it once it has been quarentined. 
   This is one place to get it from:
   https://github.com/UTFSAE/KMSAuto-Net-2015-v1.3.8-Portable
   (I did a google search for "KMSAuto Net 2015 v1.3.8 Portable" and found that site)
