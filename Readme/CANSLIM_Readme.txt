Track the indcies over - atleat - a running 20 day period - That is what Charlotte does.

Major Accumulation day on an index - 
	Price rising more than 1% and volume higher (How much)
	
Distribution Day :
	

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5/11/2020 (Monday) Meeting:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major accumulation - Price +1% and volume higher
Minor accumulation - Price +0.2% and volume higher
Major Distribution - Price -1% and volume higher
Minor Distribution - Price -.2 to 1% and volume higher 

One rule to discount distribution day:
If the market closed today that is 5% higher than the distribution day (in 20 
days tht she tracks and 25 days that IBD tracks), then that distribution day is 
not counted. She does not follow that for individual stocks

WHAT SIGNALS A NEW DOWNTREND?
The most common signal of a failing uptrend or a failing stock is a
concentration of distribution days (down days with higher volume.) Keep
these signals in mind:
 3 distribution days in 6 trading days
 4 distribution days in 12 trading days
 5 distribution days in 20 trading days.
Yes, I’ve seen a healthy uptrend die in just 4 trading days (Yes, February 25
of this year with 3 distribution days out of 4 trading days.
