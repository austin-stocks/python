3. To get IBD List 
https://etfdb.com/etf/FFTY/#etf-holdings&sort_name=weight&sort_order=desc&page=1
https://etfdb.com/etf/FFTY/#holdings

https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/FFTY/holding
To get the list - 
	3a. Towards the bottom of the page and in the pull down show 100 entries. 
	3b. The sort the "Symbol" (one of the columns at the top). You 
	    really don't need to do that but I just do it. 
	3c. Then start selecting from the bottom of the list from the second but 
	    last column (the 52 Wk Change(%)), and go all way to the top and select
	    until the header row till "Symbol" (2nd column). This somehow all get 
	    the names of the companies in "Security Name" column - without getting
	    the "Security Name" header string. Now past it in excel. So now you will 
	    have 5 columns in the date but only 4 columns in the header. Insert a
	    columns only in the header by the name of "Security Name"
	3d. Remove the 2nd row - somehow a empty row gets inserted
	3e. Select all the data and remove hyperlinks. 
And you are done. Now you need to find what are the new additions
