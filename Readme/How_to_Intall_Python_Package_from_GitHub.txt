How to install a package (it intalls it automatically 
from github - I am not sure how that works but it works)

1. Open Anaconda prompt 
	It opens in the directory c:\Users\SundeepChadha (on OfficeLaptop)
	It opens in the directory c:\Users\Owner         (on Desktop)
	(Again - not sure why Anaconda prompt opens in that directory but it opens)

2. If you want to find out what is the version of the package that you currently have
   installed, then run the following
     pip show yahoo-fin (This shows more information -- about the author and the website etc)
     conda list yahoo-fin (precise, if you just want to look at the version)
   This will tell the version of just that package that is installed. 

   If you want to get the complete list, then you can run either
   pip list OR
   conda list 
   and then just scroll up to see what is the version of the package that is installed
  
3. If you wan to install a package, then run the following command:
	python -m pip install yahoo-historical

3. This installs the package in 
     C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages (For Office Laptop)
     C:\Users\Owner\AppData\Roaming\Python\Python37\site-packages (for Desktop)
  (Again not sure how this happens, but it happens - you can actually go there  and check)
    You also have a way to see all the installed packages in PyCharm - I will tell how shortly (on the side bar - as External Libs)
	

4. This installed package is then visible in pycharm - 
	File -> Settings -> Project (Your project name) -> Python interpretor  
	(Mine is set to C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe)
	
5. In Case you already have a package instailled and you want to go to a different version 
    If you already have a package installed - say yahoo-earnings-calendar ver 0.5.2 then can you update to version 0.6.0 using this
      python -m pip install yahoo-earnings-calendar==0.6.0
  
    If you want to upgrade that package to the latest 
    for e.g. this upgrades pip itself to the latest version 
      python -m pip install ––upgrade pip 

    You will see the update in the Anaconda Navigator (you need to reindex) and then somehow it is updated in the pycharm (automatically??)
	(Probably because PyCharm is pointing to the same libraraies through the python pointer - that was setup in Python Interpretor window)
