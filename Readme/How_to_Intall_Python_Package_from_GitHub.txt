How to install a package (it intalls it automatically 
from github - I am not sure how that works but it works)

1. Open Anaconda prompt 
	It opens in the directory c:\Users\SundeepChadha 
	(Again - not sure why Anaconda prompt opens in that directory but it opens)

2. Run the following command:
	python -m pip install yahoo-historical

3. This installs the package in 
	C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages 
	(Again not sure how this happens, but it happens - you can actually go there  and check)

4. This installed package is then visible in pycharm - 
	File -> Settings -> Project (Your project name) -> Python interpretor 
	(Mine is set to C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe)
	
If you already have a package installed - say yahoo-earnings-calendar ver 0.5.2 then can you update to version 0.6.0 using this
python -m pip install yahoo-earnings-calendar==0.6.0
You will see the update in the Anaconda Navigator (you need to reindex) but then somehow it is updated in the pycharm (automatically??)
