How to install a package (it intalls it automatically 
from github - I am not sure how that works but it works)

1. Open Anaconda prompt 
	It opens in the directory c:\Users\SundeepChadha 
	(Again - not sure why Anaconda prompt opens in that directory but it opens)

2. Run the following command:
	python -m pip install yahoo-historical

3. This installs the package in 
	C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages 
	(Again not sure how this happens, but it happens - you can actually go there  and check)
  You also have a way to see all the installed packages in PyCharm - I will tell how shortly (on the side bar - as External Libs)
	
4. This installed package is then visible in pycharm - 
	File -> Settings -> Project (Your project name) -> Python interpretor 
	(Mine is set to C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe)
	
5.	In Case you already have a package instailled and you want to go to a different version 
  If you already have a package installed - say yahoo-earnings-calendar ver 0.5.2 then can you update to version 0.6.0 using this
  python -m pip install yahoo-earnings-calendar==0.6.0
  You will see the update in the Anaconda Navigator (you need to reindex) and then somehow it is updated in the pycharm (automatically??)
	(Probably because PyCharm is pointing to the same libraraies through the python pointer - that was setup in Python Interpretor window)
