                                 REMEMBER
THERE WILL ALWAYS MORE THINGS TO DO THAN YOU CAN PROBABLY DO - 
AND THAT IS A GOOD THING - JIM ROHN SAID - IT IS GREAT THE KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE MORE TO DO THAN YOU CAN DO
So, you should probably feel grateful that you have more things
to do - than you can probably do. 

The following is the list of items that needs to be worked on 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Candlestick charts with volume overlay - maybe have two separate charts
2. Adjustment to price channels - This one needs more looking at charts and understanding 
3. Two or more sets of Theoritical Earnings projections lines [The plastic overlay]
    a. Should have a start date (with matching capability)
    b. Should have a stop (for how many quarter you want to lines to continue)
    c. Should have the capability to stop when the next lines start
    
4. Log charts
5. Financial Analysis - Peter Lynch, Phil Town, CSW, Manan Shroff - others
6. Schiller PE chart overlay? 
7. Long term SPY and DOW charts with their earnings?
8. How to log messages in python? 
9. Keep on extracting Earnings from xlsm
10. Think about your own TrackList - where to get earnings date?
11. Get the fiscal quarter lined up with gridlines
12. How to increase the figure area and reduce the white space in the file
13. Do you need more than one git to experiment etc?
