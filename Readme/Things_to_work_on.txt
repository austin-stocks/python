                                 REMEMBER
THERE WILL ALWAYS MORE THINGS TO DO THAN YOU CAN PROBABLY DO - 
AND THAT IS A GOOD THING - JIM ROHN SAID - IT IS GREAT TO KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE MORE TO DO THAN YOU CAN DO
So, you should probably feel grateful that you have more things
to do - than you can probably do. 

The following is the list of items that needs to be worked on 
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Keep on extracting Earnings from xlsm
5. Price channels with Analyst accuracy based adjustment - Needs more though and discussion with Ann
6. Financial Analysis - Peter Lynch, Phil Town, CSW, Manan Shroff - others
7. Long term SPY and DOW charts with their earnings?
8. Think about your own TrackList - where to get earnings date?
8. How to increase the figure area and reduce the white space in the file
10. Do you need more than one git to experiment etc?
12. As per Ann - want to turn off the numbers besides the black and white diamonds
13. Remove the weekend dates from Candlestick and Volume

-- Got this working - Keep on refining it
2. Logging for scripts
-- Done but keep on preparing more to see if there are any bugs
3. Log charts
- maybe refine it more with some projections from -20% to +20%
- but first let Ann experiment with it
4. Schiller PE chart overlay
